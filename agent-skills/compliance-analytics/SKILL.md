# Security Compliance Analytics

Use this skill when the user asks:

- "What are our top security risks?"
- "Which controls are failing?"
- "What evidence can I show an auditor?"
- "Which assets concentrate critical risk?"
- "What changed in runtime or AI governance posture?"
- "How would this land in Snowflake or ClickHouse?"
- "Create a point-in-time assessment snapshot for vendor diligence"
- "What does the current posture API say?"

## Required Artifacts

If the lakehouse has not been built, run:

```bash
security-lakehouse pipeline run \
  --raw data/raw/security_events.jsonl \
  --out build/lakehouse
```

For dashboard review:

```bash
security-lakehouse dashboard \
  --lake build/lakehouse \
  --out build/dashboard/index.html
```

For the human and agent API:

```bash
security-lakehouse serve --lake build/lakehouse --port 8787
```

Agent routes:

- `GET /api/v1/posture/current`
- `GET /api/v1/violations`
- `GET /api/v1/controls`
- `GET /api/v1/assets`
- `POST /api/v1/snapshots`

## Query Patterns

Top failing controls:

```sql
select control_id, framework, status, risk_score, evidence_count, event_count
from control_posture
order by risk_score desc, open_event_count desc;
```

Highest-risk assets:

```sql
select asset_id, asset_type, asset_owner, environment, risk_score, critical_open, high_open
from asset_risk
order by risk_score desc;
```

Evidence behind one control:

```sql
select event_time, source, event_type, asset_id, severity, status, evidence_ref
from normalized_events
where control_ids_json like '%SOC2-CC6.1%'
order by event_time desc;
```

Backend architecture evidence:

- Snowflake governed evidence lake: `deploy/snowflake/schema.sql`
- ClickHouse telemetry analytics lake: `deploy/clickhouse/schema.sql`
- Dual-backend diagram: `docs/diagrams/dual-lakehouse.md`

Current posture:

```bash
security-lakehouse assessment status --lake build/lakehouse
```

Open violations:

```bash
security-lakehouse assessment violations --lake build/lakehouse
```

## Response Rules

- Cite generated artifacts or SQL results for every material claim.
- Separate observed evidence from recommended next actions.
- Do not claim certification, compliance, or remediation completion unless the
  generated control posture says `pass`.
- Treat `evidence_ref` as a pointer; do not invent contents that are not in the
  lakehouse artifacts.
