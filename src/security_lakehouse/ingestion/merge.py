"""Idempotent upsert keyed on a natural key.

**Idempotent** means: re-running the same sync produces the same silver state,
never duplicates. Pulls overlap (watermarks are inclusive, retries re-deliver),
so the merge must collapse repeats deterministically. With a ``recency`` key the
newest row per natural key wins (last-writer-wins on a load/updated timestamp);
without one the first occurrence is kept. Input order is otherwise preserved.
