"""Common Control Framework: safeguards as the operated object.

The control catalog is framework-first — 942 requirements, each carrying its own
``evidence_requirement``. Answering all of them means answering the same question
once per framework.

A safeguard inverts that. It is the thing an operator actually runs: one evidence
requirement, one evaluation rule, one owner. Framework requirements map *into* it,
many-to-one, and framework readiness is derived from safeguard posture rather than
computed alongside it.

The relationship is many-to-many in both directions, and deliberately so:

* one safeguard satisfies many requirements across frameworks — the point of a CCF
* one requirement may need several safeguards — SOC2 CC7.2 wants both detection
  and audit logging, so it is met only when *both* pass

That second case is why :func:`requirement_status` requires every mapped safeguard
to pass. Treating "any" as sufficient would let a passing logging safeguard report
a monitoring requirement as met.
