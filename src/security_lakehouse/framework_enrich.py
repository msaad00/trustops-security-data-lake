"""Fill placeholder control titles from public-domain NIST catalogs.

58% of the control catalog carries titles that are an identifier plus
boilerplate — "FedRAMP Moderate IR-3 — assessed from cloud posture and audit
evidence". For those the catalog records *which* control exists, not what it
requires, so nothing can be mapped into a safeguard on evidence a reviewer can
check.

Two rules decide what this may touch, and they come from the registry's own
``copyright_guardrail`` fields rather than from convenience:

* **NIST SP 800-53, CSF, and AI RMF are public-domain U.S. government work.**
  Their control titles can be stored verbatim, and are checkable by anyone
  against the published catalog.
* **ISO text is licensed.** The registry says to keep identifiers and short
  internal titles only, so ISO frameworks are never enriched here. That is a
  legal boundary, not a gap to close later.

NIST CSF 2.0 is public domain but is *not* a usable source: its OSCAL catalog
titles each subcategory with its own identifier -- ``GV.OC-01`` is titled
"GV.OC-01" -- so importing it would fill 106 titles with no content. The guard
in :func:`enrich_catalog` rejects a title that merely repeats the id, because
coverage that looks enriched but says nothing is worse than an honest
placeholder. CSF text lives in the published framework document, not here.

Every enriched title records the source URL and the SHA-256 of the exact
document it came from, so provenance is verifiable rather than asserted.
