"""Shared webhook subscription + event-dispatch service functions.

Pure, transport-agnostic functions that wrap the ``db.webhooks`` repository
plus outbound delivery. They take a SQLAlchemy session, a ``tenant_id``, and
plain params, and return plain dicts ready to drop into any response
envelope. Write functions own their commit, matching ``services.grc``.

``dispatch_event`` is the orchestration entry point called after a finding or
assessment write completes: it fans an event out to every enabled matching
subscription and never raises, regardless of how many receivers are slow or
dead, so it is always safe to call from the write path without risking that
write's success.

    """Fan ``event_type`` out to every enabled matching subscription for ``tenant_id``.

    Best-effort and defensive by design: an error looking up subscriptions, a
    delivery failure, or a DB error recording the outcome is logged and
    swallowed, never raised, so this can always be called after a write
    completes without risking that write's already-committed result. Returns
    the list of delivery outcomes for callers that want to inspect them (tests
    do; the write path does not).

    ``deliver`` defaults to :func:`webhook_delivery.deliver_webhook`, resolved
    at call time (not bound as a default argument) so tests can monkeypatch
    this module's ``deliver_webhook`` name and have it take effect even for
    callers — like the FastAPI routes — that never pass ``deliver`` explicitly.

    This function never commits or rolls back ``session`` itself. It can run
    mid-request, before the caller's own pending work is committed (e.g. an
    agent-decision approval flow that still has to write its execution record
    and commit *after* this returns) — committing here would finalize that
    unrelated work early, and if the caller's later commit then failed, a
    client retry would re-invoke this function and double-deliver. Every
    read/write below runs inside its own SAVEPOINT (``session.begin_nested()``),
    so a failure is isolated to that one sub-unit of work: it rolls back only
    the savepoint (never poisoning the caller's outer transaction the way an
    unhandled failed statement would on Postgres), and a success is retained
    in the still-open, uncommitted outer transaction for the caller to commit
    on its own terms.
