"""Outbound event webhook signing + delivery (transport-agnostic, no DB).

TrustOps's API is otherwise pull-only. A registered subscription (see
``db.webhooks``) lets a tenant receive a push the moment something happens —
a new finding, a completed assessment, a control transitioning to failing —
instead of polling. This module is the sending half: build the signed
envelope and POST it, with the same SSRF guard every other outbound egress
path in this codebase uses (:mod:`security_lakehouse.netguard`).

Signing follows the GitHub/Stripe convention: the raw JSON body is HMAC-SHA256
signed with the subscriber's registered secret, and the hex digest travels in
an ``X-TrustOps-Signature: sha256=<hex>`` header so a receiver can verify the
delivery actually came from this TrustOps instance and was not tampered with
in transit. See ``docs/WEBHOOKS.md`` for the receiver-side verification code.

Delivery never raises: every failure (non-2xx, timeout, DNS, SSRF-blocked
target) is caught and returned as ``{"ok": False, ...}`` so a slow or dead
receiver can never fail the caller's write path. Retries once by default with
a short backoff, matching "at least one retry" — this is intentionally a
synchronous call, not a queue: the codebase has no background job worker
today, and adding one is out of scope for this slice (see docs/WEBHOOKS.md).

# TRUSTOPS_WORKFLOW_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST (see workflows.py's action.webhook), and
# deliberately NOT deny-by-default the way that one is. That allowlist gates
# an admin-authored automation step POSTing to an admin-chosen target; this
# gates a *tenant's own* subscription registered to receive that tenant's own
# compliance events -- the GitHub/Stripe self-service webhook model, where a
# customer registers any endpoint they control without needing a platform
# operator to allowlist it first. Coupling the two (or defaulting this one to
# deny-all) would make every webhook subscription undeliverable out of the box
# for any operator who has not also configured workflow egress, for an
# unrelated feature. The SSRF guard (assert_url_is_public, below) already
# blocks the classic internal-metadata-service target regardless of this
# allowlist's state; this allowlist is an *additional*, opt-in restriction for
# operators who want to cap egress to specific approved destinations (e.g. an
# approved SIEM vendor's IP range) even among public addresses.
