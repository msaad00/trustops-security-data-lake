"""Shared SSRF / URL-safety guard for outbound and inbound HTTP.

Both the workflow egress path and the inbound connector clients route
credentialed requests at operator-supplied hosts. This module centralizes the
defense so the check is identical on every path: only ``http``/``https`` is
allowed, and the *resolved* address(es) must be public — a public-looking name
that resolves to a private/loopback address (DNS rebinding, split-horizon) is
still blocked.

Validating the *first* URL is not enough: ``urllib``'s default opener silently
follows 3xx redirects, and paginating clients follow server-supplied ``Link``
URLs. Either lets a validated host pivot the credentialed request at an internal
address. ``open_guarded`` closes that gap — it re-runs the caller's validator on
every redirect hop and drops credential headers on any cross-origin hop, so the
guard cannot be bypassed after the first request.
