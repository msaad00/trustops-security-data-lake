"""Connector health: detect sources that have gone silent.

Evidence freshness already flags *stale evidence*. This adds the complementary
signal the continuous loop needs — **silent failure**: a connector that synced
fine before but has had no *successful* sync within its freshness SLO. A failing
or never-running connector that still looks "configured" is exactly how a
compliance pipeline silently rots, so health is keyed on the latest sync whose
``result`` is ``ok`` (a failed sync does not reset the clock).

Health per enabled connector:

* ``healthy``        — a successful sync within one SLO window.
* ``degraded``       — last success older than one SLO window (overdue).
* ``silent``         — last success older than ``SILENT_SLO_FACTOR`` windows, or
                       a connector that has never succeeded since being enabled.
* ``never_succeeded``— enabled but no successful sync on record yet.

Disabled connectors are reported as ``disabled`` and excluded from the rollup.
