"""Staged framework readiness gate.

A framework is "implemented" only after every gate below closes. The UI
shows the current stage so reviewers can see exactly what's blocking a
coverage claim.

Stages (advance left → right):
  source_pulled        official source fetched + sha256 + pulled_at populated
  mapped               every control has a reviewed control_id ↔ article mapping
  evidence_defined     every control declares an evidence_requirement (catalog)
  rule_versioned       every control declares an evaluation_rule (catalog)
  coverage_verified    mapping_coverage_pct ≥ 95 AND every prior gate is closed

The earliest unmet gate is reported per framework so the UI surface "what to
fix next" is unambiguous.
