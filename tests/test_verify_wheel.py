"""The wheel gate that stands between a build and PyPI.

`src/security_lakehouse/web/dist` is gitignored and built by `make web-build`.
A wheel packaged before that step is valid, installable, and silently
consoleless — which is the exact failure the quick start hit in #562, except
published to every user instead of one clone.
