"""The console must not call the frozen pre-v1 surface.

`docs/API_V1_MIGRATION.md` promised this check ("CI: fail if `app/web` imports
`/api/` paths outside an allowlist") and it was never implemented, which is why
thirteen call sites in the API client and eight in-product agent recipes
survived the migration unnoticed.

Two shapes have to be checked, and missing the first is how this stayed hidden:

* `lib/api/client.ts` prefixes every request with ``BASE = "/api"``, so its
  calls read ``get("/violations")`` — there is no ``/api/`` in the source to
  grep for.
* Everywhere else (docs strings, the agent recipe catalog) writes the absolute
  path, ``"/api/violations"``.

`/api/healthz` and `/api/public/...` stay allowed: the first is the liveness
probe used by the container healthcheck and the ALB, the second is the
unauthenticated reviewer share.
