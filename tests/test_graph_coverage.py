"""Coverage & gap analysis over the directed compliance graph (BR-7).

``analyze_coverage`` follows ``framework -> control -> evidence -> asset`` and
reports which assets are reached by control evidence, which controls have no
evidence (orphans), and which frameworks have no covered control. This is
compliance coverage/gap analysis, not infra attack-path reachability.
