# Release readiness

TrustOps **0.2.14** adds OSCAL export, third-party connector registration via
Python entry points, outbound event webhooks, and converts most framework
packs to a data-driven manifest format. See [the changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)
for release scope.

## Release gates

A source test, successful CI run, published artifact, and authenticated deployment
are separate evidence. Run the checks below on the final revision; publish only
when its required CI checks pass.

| Gate                 | Verification                                                                                            | Required outcome                                                                                               |

| Publication          | Version tag on the verified main revision                                                               | GitHub, PyPI, and container publication jobs succeed                                                           |
| Published artifacts  | Fresh install and container smoke checks                                                                | Version, bundled console, health, authenticated authorization, persistence, and integrity checks pass          |

The release workflow verifies the tag against the package, chart, and console,
builds the wheel with the console, and publishes through PyPI trusted publishing.
A branch merge alone does not publish a release.

## What the overview means

- **Assessment score** is the control-count-weighted framework score out of 100.
- **Control pass rate** is passing test rows divided by total test rows. The chart
  separates pass, fail, warning, and remaining **Other** results. Unevaluated
  controls are not displayed as a zero-percent result.
- **Open findings** and severity counts describe the current assessment. Other
  findings are those outside the critical and high groups.
- **Frameworks assessed** describes assessed coverage, not certification or a
  complete assessment of every requirement in a framework.
- **Evidence freshness** and **assessment export** are separate from the score.
  A connected update stream does not establish that evidence is current.

## Evidence boundaries

Synthetic fixture tests demonstrate reproducible application behavior, including
failure and authorization paths. They do not establish live collection accuracy,
precision, recall, customer capacity, vendor cost savings, or production readiness.

Local Polaris/Iceberg and independent-reader tests establish only the catalog,
snapshot, schema, and data-parity behaviors covered by those tests. They do not
establish interoperability with every hosted warehouse or object store.

A Docker build or Helm render is not an authenticated cloud deployment. Private
cloud-account experiments must be documented separately with sanitized results;
never commit credentials, account identifiers, raw customer evidence, or private
commercial information to this public repository.

## Deployment acceptance

Before sharing a hosted pilot, validate the target environment directly:

1. HTTPS, external authentication, tenant isolation, and role-based access.
2. Required read-only connector grants and complete collection with failure
   reporting, freshness, and provenance.
3. Integrity verification, durable evidence and snapshots, backup and restore.
4. Scheduler behavior, resource limits, logs, monitoring, and incident ownership.
5. Scoped export/share creation, expiry, revocation, and audit records.
6. Workload-specific throughput, data volume, latency, and operating cost.

Certification decisions require the applicable independent assessment process.
Framework mappings and executable checks support evidence review; they do not
replace that process.
