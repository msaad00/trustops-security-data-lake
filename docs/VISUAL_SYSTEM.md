# Visual System

The product should feel like an assessment console, not a report. The visual
language should make current posture, violations, owners, evidence, and
snapshots understandable for both humans and agents.

Product name, logo, taglines, and naming hierarchy: [BRAND.md](BRAND.md).

## TrustOps mark

- Gradient monogram (`#4f7cff` → `#30c7d2`) with white **T** — use
  `TrustOpsMark` / `TrustOpsLogo` in the console shell; SVG wordmark in docs.
- Console chrome label: **TrustOps Console** (sidebar subtitle), not
  "Workbench" or "Assessment Console".

## Framework visual identity

Neutral **gradient marks** with Lucide icons identify each program (SOC 2, ISO,
FedRAMP, CIS AWS, etc.) without shipping official certification logos. See
`app/web/src/lib/framework-visuals.ts`, `FrameworkMark`, and `FrameworkBadge`.

Shared KPI tiles use `KpiTile` with tone accents (default / ready / attention /
critical / brand). Compliance rings and bar scoreboards mirror managed GRC-style
program dashboards on the **Trust Command Center** (`/dashboard`) and
**Continuous control monitoring** summary (`/controls`).

| Deploy            | OSS / self-hosted / hosted models + go-live flow              |

## Framework identity

Framework identity combines exact official names with project-owned Lucide
icons. Two NIST framework illustrations are approved and self-hosted with
attribution; other official marks remain restricted or unavailable. See
[THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md](THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md) and
`frameworks/identity-assets.json` for the provenance record.

| Family     | Component        | Policy                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Frameworks | `FrameworkBadge` | Approved NIST artwork or icon + exact official name |
| Connectors | `ConnectorMark`  | Brand SVG logos (Simple Icons) with text fallback   |
| Identity   | `AuthMark`       | IdP-colored abbreviations — Okta, Entra, SAML, KEY  |

## Interaction Patterns

- filters for framework, owner, severity, source, status, and environment
- collapsible evidence details
- clickable controls and assets
- snapshot button with explicit reason
- copyable API routes
- tags for `current`, `snapshot`, `stale`, `open`, `owner`, `framework`
- horizontal **flow strips** for ingestion, auth, and deployment paths
