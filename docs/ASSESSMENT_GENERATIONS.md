# Assessment publication and failure contracts

TrustOps keeps local JSONL and SQL artifacts as its working evidence mode. An
assessment publication consists of one verified generation. Parquet, an Iceberg
REST adapter, and Polaris interoperability remain planned work; the Helm chart
does not implement those integrations.

## Invalid rules and incomplete collection

Unknown named rules and malformed inline predicates raise `PolicyError`. The
pipeline validates every catalog rule before evaluating, including controls with
no evidence and incremental runs with unchanged raw input. CLI evaluation exits
nonzero; API evaluation records an error and retains the prior published view.
A catalog or tenant change forces a new incremental assessment.

The shared cursor paginator raises `IncompleteCollectionError` when its page
budget is exhausted while a continuation cursor remains. It exposes
`pages_fetched` and `cursor` to its caller, without including the cursor in logs.
Finishing exactly at the budget is successful. Connector collectors consume the
whole iterator before writing evidence, so an incomplete pull records an error
and preserves raw evidence, the watermark, and the published assessment. Retry
starts from the previous successful watermark; durable partial-page checkpointing
is not implemented. These guarantees apply to consumers of the shared paginator,
not every provider-specific SDK pagination loop.

## Publication layout

```text
lake/
  generations/<generation-id>/
    catalog/                       # evaluated controls and catalog bundle summary
    bronze/ silver/ gold/ mart/    # materialized assessment artifacts
    manifest.json                 # counts, tenant, catalog digest, pinned paths
    generation.json               # SHA-256 digests for every generated artifact
  .active-generation -> generations/<generation-id>
  bronze/ silver/ gold/ mart/      # per-artifact links through the active pointer
  raw/                            # mutable intake remains outside generations
```

Operational files such as connector configuration, run history, assignments,
review events, and snapshot ledgers remain outside generations even where they
share the `gold` directory with assessment links.

Writers serialize per lake with an advisory directory lock. They stage a new
unique directory, verify evidence integrity and SQLite consistency, hash and
flush the artifacts, and atomically replace the active symlink. Before the
switch, a failed write or failed verification leaves the prior generation
active. Existing local lakes are migrated by retaining a copy of their previous
artifacts before installing compatibility links. The first successful publication
then switches to the new generation.

Published artifacts reject writes through TrustOps shared JSON IO. Local
administrators can still edit files directly; integrity verification detects
such changes. This is not object-lock/WORM storage or cryptographic signing.
Historical and interrupted staging directories are retained. Automatic generation
retention and garbage collection are not implemented; account for disk growth.

## Reading and exporting

Posture, graph, framework-detail, ingestion-status, integrity, dashboard export,
and shared legacy/v1 API reads pin their generated JSON IO for the duration of
one operation. Assessment snapshots retain the generation identity and catalog
bundle used for that publication. V1 response metadata includes the generation
identity; separate requests can observe different generations.

`PipelineResult` paths identify the generation directly. To run several external
file or SQL reads against one assessment, use those returned paths or resolve
`.active-generation` once and read exclusively inside that directory. Reopening
the compatibility links for each file can cross a publication boundary. API
pagination across multiple requests does not yet offer a historical-generation
selector; compare returned generation identities before combining pages.

`security-lakehouse pipeline verify-integrity --lake <lake-directory>` checks the published
generation hashes as well as evidence integrity. An explicit generation directory
can also be inspected with `verify_generation(Path(...))` from
`security_lakehouse.generations`.

## Scope of validation

Regression tests inject failures during artifact writes, SQL materialization,
posture generation, and the pointer switch. They also cover interleaved reads,
legacy migration, catalog invalidation, corruption, cross-tenant pointer denial,
CLI/API errors, and preservation of previously published exports.

Publication requires a local POSIX filesystem with atomic same-filesystem rename,
symlinks, directory locks, and fsync support. This does not establish crash or
locking guarantees for NFS, object storage, Windows, or distributed writers. No
Iceberg commit, independent SQL-engine interoperability, or cloud deployment is
proved by these tests.
