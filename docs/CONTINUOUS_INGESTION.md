# Continuous Ingestion Operating Model

TrustOps is not meant to run as a pile of one-off bootstrap scripts. Bootstrap
artifacts create customer-owned read scopes. The running product then uses the
same connector contract from the UI, REST API, CLI, scheduler, and agents.

```text
customer admin/IaC -> scoped identity + read views
operator/API       -> discover -> probe -> enable
scheduler          -> sync -> materialize -> evaluate -> snapshot/workflow
reviewers/agents   -> read posture, runs, evidence, snapshots, trust shares
```

## Responsibilities

| Layer              | Owns                                      | Must not own                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Customer platform  | Snowflake user, cloud role, secret mount  | TrustOps app code                    |
| TrustOps connector | read scope, fingerprint, sync history     | passwords, PATs, raw private keys    |
| Scheduler          | due checks, locks, sync/evaluation runs   | broad cloud permissions              |
| Assessment engine  | normalized evidence, controls, snapshots | connector-specific compliance claims |

## Production Flow

1. **Provision access outside TrustOps.**
   Use Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation, Snowflake SQL, or the customer secret
   manager. Identities are non-human and read-only by default.

2. **Discover available scope.**
   Discovery returns selectable databases, views, accounts, subscriptions, or
   recommended options without enabling collection.

   ```bash
   security-lakehouse connectors discover \
     --lake /lake \
     --connector-id snowflake-evidence-lake \
     --account "$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT" \
     --user TRUSTOPS_INGEST_SVC \
     --warehouse TRUSTOPS_READ_WH \
     --database TRUSTOPS_SECURITY_LAKE \
     --schema EVIDENCE
   ```

3. **Probe exact access.**
   Probe validates the same identity and read scope that will be enabled. It
   writes a non-secret access fingerprint to `gold/connector_runs.jsonl`.

   ```bash
   security-lakehouse connectors probe \
     --lake /lake \
     --connector-id snowflake-evidence-lake \
     --credentials-json '{"account":"'"$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"'","user":"TRUSTOPS_INGEST_SVC","private_key_ref":"SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE"}' \
     --options-json '{"warehouse":"TRUSTOPS_READ_WH","database":"TRUSTOPS_SECURITY_LAKE","schema":"EVIDENCE","role":"TRUSTOPS_READER","audit_events":"TRUSTOPS_AUDIT_EVENTS","control_posture":"TRUSTOPS_CONTROL_POSTURE","asset_risk":"TRUSTOPS_ASSET_RISK","evidence_bundles":"TRUSTOPS_EVIDENCE_BUNDLES"}'
   ```

4. **Enable only after a successful probe.**
   Public API and console enablement require the latest probe to be `ok` and to
   match the same credential/scope fingerprint.

   ```bash
   security-lakehouse connectors configure \
     --lake /lake \
     --connector-id snowflake-evidence-lake \
     --state enabled \
     --credentials-json '{"account":"'"$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"'","user":"TRUSTOPS_INGEST_SVC","private_key_ref":"SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE"}' \
     --options-json '{"warehouse":"TRUSTOPS_READ_WH","database":"TRUSTOPS_SECURITY_LAKE","schema":"EVIDENCE","role":"TRUSTOPS_READER","audit_events":"TRUSTOPS_AUDIT_EVENTS","control_posture":"TRUSTOPS_CONTROL_POSTURE","asset_risk":"TRUSTOPS_ASSET_RISK","evidence_bundles":"TRUSTOPS_EVIDENCE_BUNDLES"}' \
     --sync-schedule "every 15m"
   ```

5. **Run continuously.**
   Production deployments should run `security-lakehouse scheduler tick` from a
   Kubernetes `CronJob`, system cron, CI scheduler, Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, or
   another orchestrator. The Helm chart ships a scheduler CronJob.

6. **Review outcomes from API/UI/agents.**
   Connector run history, evidence, controls, snapshots, and integrity checks
   are exposed through `/api/v1` resources and the console. Collection endpoints
   paginate with `limit` `1..1000`, `offset`, sort, filters, and next cursors.

## Runtime Contract

| Concern           | Current behavior                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials       | Connector config stores references and fingerprints, not raw passwords or private keys.            |
| Enablement        | Public enablement is probe-gated and rejects changed scope until the new payload is probed.        |
| Scheduling        | `scheduler tick` uses an advisory lock and persisted last-fired state to avoid overlapping fires.  |
| Idempotency       | Connector raw events are upserted by `event_id`; overlapping syncs do not double-count evidence.   |
| Incremental reads | Full-scope sync is safe by idempotent upsert; cursor/watermark adapters use ingestion primitives.  |
| Rate limits       | Shared backoff primitives exist; adapter-specific 429/backoff handling is implemented where wired. |
| API limits        | Collection APIs cap `limit` at 1000 and return `400 bad_request` for invalid paging params.        |
| Errors            | Sync/probe failures are recorded in `gold/connector_runs.jsonl` with sanitized messages.           |
| Integrity         | Pipeline integrity records evidence hashes and idempotency set hashes in gold artifacts.           |
| Snapshots         | Point-in-time snapshots are hash-chained and verifiable through `/api/v1/snapshots/integrity`.     |
| Agents            | Agents consume the same API/resources; model output can propose actions, not bypass controls.      |

## Snowflake Production Pattern

For Snowflake, `deploy/snowflake/bootstrap_poc.sql` and
`deploy/snowflake/bootstrap_service_user.sql` are examples of the customer-side
admin/IaC step. In production, a team should convert those objects into its
normal change-management system:

- `TRUSTOPS_READER` is a read-only role.
- `TRUSTOPS_INGEST_SVC` is a non-human service user.
- The RSA public key is set in Snowflake.
- The matching private key is stored in the customer secret manager.
- The TrustOps runtime mounts the private key and sets
  `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`.

In Kubernetes, mount the key as a Secret and pass the file path to both the API
pod and scheduler CronJob through Helm values:

```yaml
env:
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT
    value: MJFAYEE-YS65534
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_USER
    value: TRUSTOPS_INGEST_SVC
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_AUTHENTICATOR
    value: SNOWFLAKE_JWT
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
    value: /var/run/secrets/trustops/snowflake_key.p8
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_ROLE
    value: TRUSTOPS_READER
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE
    value: TRUSTOPS_READ_WH
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE
    value: TRUSTOPS_SECURITY_LAKE
  - name: SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA
    value: EVIDENCE

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: snowflake-key
    mountPath: /var/run/secrets/trustops
    readOnly: true

extraVolumes:
  - name: snowflake-key
    secret:
      secretName: trustops-snowflake-key
```

The bootstrap SQL proves the required Snowflake boundary; the continuous
TrustOps value comes from scheduled sync, deterministic evaluation, fresh
evidence status, snapshots, and shared API/UI/agent access to the same state.

## API Surface

The headless path uses the same operations as the UI:

| Operation                 | Route                                           | Scope              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| List connectors           | `GET /api/v1/connectors`                        | `read`             |
| List connector run history | `GET /api/v1/connectors/{connector_id}/runs`   | `read`             |
| Discover scope            | `POST /api/v1/connectors/{connector_id}/discover` | `connector_manage` |
| Probe access              | `POST /api/v1/connectors/{connector_id}/probe`  | `connector_manage` |
| Configure connector       | `POST /api/v1/connectors/{connector_id}/configure` | `connector_manage` |
| Create snapshot           | `POST /api/v1/snapshots`                        | `snapshot`         |
| Verify snapshot chain     | `GET /api/v1/snapshots/integrity`               | `read`             |

This is the path external portals, internal platform automation, MCP tools, and
agent harnesses should use. CLI examples are wrappers around the same contract,
not a separate operating mode.
