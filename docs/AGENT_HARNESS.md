# Agent Harness

TrustOps can run human and headless agent workflows without moving compliance
truth into an LLM.

The core remains deterministic:

```text
connectors -> evidence -> assets -> controls -> mappings -> posture -> snapshots -> trust shares -> audit
```

The optional agent harness wraps that core:

```text
redacted TrustOps facts -> deterministic tools -> optional model context -> proposed actions -> approval -> TrustOps API write -> audit event
```

This document is not the harness. It is the operator contract. The executable
harness lives in `src/security_lakehouse/agents/`, and the behavior is locked
by `tests/test_agents.py`.

## Package shape

The first harness lives under `security_lakehouse.agents`:

- `budgets.py` enforces context size, fact count, and output-token budgets
  before any optional provider call.
- `providers.py` reads optional model configuration from environment.
- `state.py` defines the shared agent run state and action proposal record.
- `tools.py` exposes typed, redaction-aware TrustOps fact readers.
- `model_contract.py` builds the model-safe prompt/context and validates
  model-proposed tool calls.
- `model_client.py` contains dependency-free optional provider clients for
  Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and Anthropic.
- `evaluations.py` computes deterministic harness checks, failures, coverage,
  score, confidence, and risk level from TrustOps state.
- `graphs.py` runs the first posture-review flow and can compile a LangGraph
  graph when `trustops-security-data-lake[agents]` is installed.

## Provider defaults

No model is required. If no provider is configured, the harness runs in
`rules_only` mode.

Environment knobs:

| Variable                         | Purpose                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_PROVIDER`        | `rules_only`, `ollama`, `openai`, `openai_compatible`, `anthropic`, or a future adapter        |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_MODEL`           | Provider model name                                                                            |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_BASE_URL`        | Local provider URL, defaulting to Ollama at `http://127.0.0.1:11434` when provider is `ollama` |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_API_KEY_ENV`     | Name of the environment variable holding the provider API key                                  |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_USE_MODEL`       | Set to `1` to actually call the provider; unset means deterministic harness only               |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Optional provider request timeout, clamped between 1 and 120 seconds                           |

`openai_compatible` is supported for local or customer-chosen providers that
serve `/chat/completions`. The harness records provider metadata but never
prints raw API keys.

## Budget policy

Model use is budgeted by the harness, not by prompt wording. Defaults are small
enough for local models and CI:

| Variable                           | Default | Purpose                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` | 12000   | Maximum serialized context sent to a model after compaction           |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_MAX_FACT_ITEMS`    | 20      | Maximum evidence gaps, alerts, and deterministic decisions in context |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | 600     | Maximum provider output tokens requested                              |
| `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_MAX_STRING_CHARS`  | 1000    | Maximum individual string length before deterministic truncation      |

The CLI also accepts per-run overrides:

```bash
security-lakehouse agents soc-triage \
  --lake ./lake \
  --provider ollama \
  --model llama3.1 \
  --max-fact-items 10 \
  --max-context-chars 8000 \
  --max-output-tokens 300
```

Every model context includes a `budget` object with estimated context size,
estimated tokens, applied item limits, omitted counts, and `status`. If context
still exceeds budget after deterministic compaction, the harness records
`model_skipped: context_budget_exceeded`, stays in `rules_only` mode, and does
not call the provider.

## Evaluation and confidence

Every harness run returns an `evaluation` object:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "score": 100,
  "confidence": "high",
  "risk_level": "low",
  "checks": [],
  "failures": [],
  "coverage": {}
}
```

Confidence is computed by TrustOps, not by the model. The harness scores
allowed actions, approval gating, rejected tool-call tracking, context-budget
enforcement, and use-case coverage such as evidence-gap or high-priority alert
coverage. If a model returns its own confidence field, TrustOps ignores it.

Rejected model tool calls are treated as useful safety telemetry. They do not
execute and do not make the run unsafe by themselves, but they lower deterministic
confidence to `medium` because the model attempted something outside the
approved contract.

## First workflow

`run_posture_review(...)`:

1. loads current posture
2. applies role redaction
3. loads missing/stale/expired evidence gaps
4. proposes evidence-request actions
5. marks every write as `requires_approval`

This is intentionally deterministic. LangGraph can orchestrate the same nodes,
and later model-backed nodes can summarize or prioritize, but they must consume
the already-redacted state and act only through TrustOps APIs.

With `TRUSTOPS_AGENT_USE_MODEL=1`, the optional provider receives:

- the objective
- role-redacted posture
- role-redacted evidence gaps
- deterministic action proposals
- an allowed tool manifest
- a strict JSON output schema

The model may return summaries, priority ordering, and proposed tool calls.
TrustOps validates tool names and keeps every write as `requires_approval`.
The model cannot mark a control passing, mutate evidence, bypass RBAC, or
execute writes.

## Use-case harnesses

The harness pattern is use-case oriented. Each harness must run without a
model, expose only approved tool proposals, and carry deterministic evaluation
results.

| Harness        | Deterministic inputs                                               | Model role                                                 | Guardrail evaluation                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Posture review | current posture, evidence gaps, role redaction                     | summarize and rank evidence requests                       | proposed writes require approval and stay in the allowed tool set                   |
| SOC triage     | open detection, vulnerability, runtime, cloud, and identity alerts | summarize, rank, and propose case/enrichment/owner actions | high/critical open alerts must have proposed actions; all writes are approval-gated |

Run the SOC harness locally:

```bash
security-lakehouse agents soc-triage --lake ./lake --role read_only
```

Configuring a provider still does not call a model unless `--use-model` or
`TRUSTOPS_AGENT_USE_MODEL=1` is set:

```bash
security-lakehouse agents soc-triage \
  --lake ./lake \
  --provider ollama \
  --model llama3.1
```

## Self-hosted run modes

Teams can run the harness without changing the compliance engine:

| Mode           | How it runs                                                                              | Use when                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CLI            | `security-lakehouse agents posture-review --lake <lake>`                                 | local audits, CI checks, demos |
| Scheduler      | cron, Kubernetes `CronJob`, or the TrustOps scheduler                                    | recurring evidence-gap review  |
| Service worker | internal worker calls `/api/v1/*` and writes proposed actions back through TrustOps APIs | production agent operations    |
| UI/API trigger | console button or headless API starts a saved workflow                                   | human-in-the-loop review       |

Self-hosted deployments keep the same boundaries: tenant-scoped lake path,
server-side RBAC, redacted reads, append-only audit events, and approval before
agent-proposed writes. LangGraph is useful for branching, retries, multi-agent
review, and long-running state, but it is not the source of compliance truth.

## Non-negotiables

Agents do not own:

- RBAC
- tenant isolation
- evidence freshness
- control pass/fail evaluation
- redaction policy
- idempotency
- snapshot hashes
- audit truth

Those stay in TrustOps core and tests.
