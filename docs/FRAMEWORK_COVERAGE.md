# Framework Coverage Matrix

Generated from the control catalog + CCF safeguards — never hand-edited.
Regenerate with `make coverage-doc`. `Attestable` is the auditor-defensible
coverage (reviewed safeguard mappings); the gap to `Evaluatable` is the
review backlog.

Frameworks: 18 (16 implemented, 2 planned)
Requirements catalogued: 2021 (all source-cited)
Evaluatable (touched by a safeguard): 813 (40.2%)
**Attestable (reviewed safeguard mapping — what an auditor accepts): 254 (12.6%)**
Asset types modeled: 20

> `Source-cited` = the requirement has an official source link (always 100%). `Evaluatable` = a safeguard claims it (reviewed or proposed). `Attestable` = a human has confirmed the safeguard→requirement mapping — the only coverage an audit accepts. The gap between Evaluatable and Attestable is the review backlog.
