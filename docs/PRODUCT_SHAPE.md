# Product Shape & Parity Map

Honest capability and UX reality for TrustOps v0.2.x — not marketing parity, but
where the platform sits versus **mature managed GRC SaaS** and what open issues
close each gap fastest.

## TL;DR

| Dimension             | Mature managed GRC SaaS     | TrustOps today                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product shape**     | Polished multi-tenant SaaS  | Self-hostable platform + optional hosted scaffold           |
| **Core GRC loop**     | Mature, turnkey             | Strong on controls, evidence, audit room, shares            |
| **UI/UX**             | Best-in-class consumer SaaS | Good foundation — Epic #96 largely shipped (~65–70% polish) |
| **Integrations**      | 100+ deep connectors        | Solid cloud/IdP core, narrower long tail                    |
| **Agents / API / CI** | Add-ons, limited vs core    | **Differentiator** — MCP, harness, headless-first           |
| **Data ownership**    | Vendor-hosted evidence      | **Customer lake** — major differentiator                    |

**Overall:** TrustOps is a credible **self-hosted / headless GRC platform** with
real audit-room depth. It is not yet a drop-in replacement for teams that want
fully managed compliance with HRIS, devices, and personnel out of the box.

| Surface             | Primary user                | Value                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Console**         | Security, GRC, auditors     | Connect sources, review posture, fix gaps, share trust |
| **API / CLI / MCP** | Engineers, CI, agents       | Sync, query, automate without the UI                   |
| **Agent harness**   | Optional AI or rules runner | Summarize gaps; approval-gated writes only             |
| **Hosted scaffold** | Teams wanting a live URL    | Signup, invites, usage limits — billing/SCIM partial   |

The assessment engine stays **model-independent**. LLMs orchestrate around
redacted facts; the engine owns normalization, control evaluation, snapshots,
hashes, RBAC, idempotency, and audit logs.

## Parity scorecard (detailed)

Rough comparison vs mature managed GRC SaaS on capability + UX reality:

| Area                        | vs mature SaaS | TrustOps strength                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| SOC 2 / ISO control library | ~80%           | Depth good; framework packs as code                  |
| Continuous monitoring       | ~75%           | Core cloud/IdP connectors runnable                   |
| Auditor experience          | ~70%           | Trust shares, PDF, audit room trends; no marketplace |
| Personnel / devices / HR    | ~30%           | Workarounds only                                     |

| SaaS polish / onboarding    | ~65–70%        | #96 shipped; incremental polish remains              |

## Where TrustOps matches well (shipped)

These are real surfaces — not roadmap slides:

- **Audit workflow (headless + UI)** — continuous control tests, audit readiness API,
  audit room, trust shares, auditor role redaction, access reviews, evidence
  requests → remediation, point-in-time snapshots, unified audit log, executive PDF
- **Framework depth** — SOC 2, NIST AI RMF, FedRAMP foundation, CIS AWS,
  ISO 27001/42001 packs
- **Identity & access** (PR [#345](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/pull/345)) —
  user/role admin, API-key → browser session, IdP group → role mapping, SCIM Users
  scaffold
- **Deploy transparency** — Helm, EKS terraform, `/console/deploy`, OSS positioning

## Where mature SaaS is still ahead

### 1. UI/UX polish ([#96](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/issues/96))

Managed GRC products feel like finished consumer apps: guided onboarding, empty
states, microcopy, notification center, mobile-friendly auditor flows, integrated
help.

TrustOps has dark mode, Trust Command Center, audit strip, workflow canvas,
connector drawers — but not the same visual refinement, marketing-grade empty
states, or zero-config wow on first login.

### 2. Integration long tail

Mature SaaS: HRIS, device MDM, ticketing, training — hundreds of pre-built checks.

TrustOps: strong AWS / Azure / GCP / Snowflake / GitHub / Okta paths with vendor
marks in-console; open connector catalog; read-only posture. Gaps: personnel/HRIS,
device MDM, pen-test coordination ([#22](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/issues/22), [#23](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/issues/23)).

### 3. Compliance OS convenience

| Feature                   | Mature SaaS  | TrustOps                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Policy employee sign-off  | Native       | **MVP shipped** — publish + acknowledgment tracking |
| Personnel tracking        | Native       | IdP + access reviews                                |
| Auditor marketplace       | Yes          | BYO auditor + trust share                           |
| Device inventory          | Integrations | Connector evidence only                             |
| Billing / self-serve SaaS | Native       | Pricing/signup scaffold; Stripe not shipped         |
| SCIM lifecycle            | Full         | Scaffold + env bearer (PR #345)                     |

### 4. Visual analytics ([#18](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/issues/18))

Insights/timeseries and posture trend exist — but not the rich trend/compliance
timeline UX used for exec and auditor storytelling ([#15](https://github.com/msaad00/trustops-security-data-lake/issues/15)).

## Where TrustOps is ahead (differentiators)

Hard for classic GRC SaaS to match:

| Differentiator                | Why it matters                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-host + customer lake** | Evidence in bronze/silver/gold — not a vendor silo            |
| **Headless-first**            | Same `/api/v1` for console, MCP, CI gates, agents             |
| **Agent harness**             | Governed runs, approval-gated writes, LangGraph orchestration |
| **Deterministic assessment**  | Control tests from lake pipeline, not widget pass/fail only   |
| **Framework packs as code**   | `frameworks sync-packs`, custom frameworks, crosswalk         |
| **Interoperable scale**       | Correlation IDs, idempotency, RBAC on every route             |

If the buyer cares about data residency, agents in the IDE, or CI-enforced posture,
TrustOps is stronger. If they want sign-up and pass SOC 2 in 90 days with zero
engineering, managed SaaS still wins on packaging.
