# Issue closeout runbook

Drain duplicate and shipped issues so **#474** / **#96** are the only active trackers. Run after each merge batch.

## Wave 2 complete (2026-07-13)

All streams **#475–#480** merged (#482–#487). Brand otter mark in **#488**.

**Maintainer — run once now:**

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 ./tools/close_shipped_issues.sh   # preview
./tools/close_shipped_issues.sh              # all batches (idempotent)
```

Cloud agent tokens cannot close issues (`403` on `closeIssue` / `addComment`). Repo owner must run locally.
