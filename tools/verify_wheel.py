"""Refuse to publish a wheel that is missing the console or its catalogs.

`src/security_lakehouse/web/dist` is gitignored and built by `make web-build`.
`pyproject.toml` declares it as package data, so a wheel built *before* that step
is valid, installable, and silently consoleless — `/console/` is mounted only
when a built console is present, so the documented URL 404s for everyone who
installs it.

The control catalogs have the same shape of problem: they ship as data-files, and
a wheel without them installs fine and then cannot evaluate anything.

Both failures are invisible until a user hits them, which is why this runs
between build and publish.
