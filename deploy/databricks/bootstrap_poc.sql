-- TrustOps Databricks evidence-lake POC bootstrap (Unity Catalog).
--
-- Run as a user who can create a catalog and read system.access.audit (a
-- metastore/account admin, or someone granted USE SCHEMA + SELECT on
-- system.access). The script creates only TrustOps-owned objects and read
-- grants. It does not create service principals, tokens, warehouses, external
-- locations, or network access.
--
-- Default objects:
--   catalog: trustops
--   schema:  trustops.evidence
--   reader:  a service principal, referenced by its application id
--
-- On SQL warehouses, Unity Catalog evaluates the view owner's permissions on
-- underlying tables, so the reader needs SELECT on these views only - never on
-- system.access.audit itself. Row-level views keep the latest 10,000 events so
-- a single read stays under the Statement Execution API INLINE limit (25 MiB).
