# Vendored OSCAL JSON Schemas

`oscal_component_schema.json` and `oscal_assessment-results_schema.json` are
the NIST OSCAL v1.2.3 JSON Schema (draft-07) release artifacts for the
`component-definition` and `assessment-results` models, fetched from the
[usnistgov/OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) `v1.2.3` GitHub release:

- <https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/download/v1.2.3/oscal_component_schema.json>
- <https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/download/v1.2.3/oscal_assessment-results_schema.json>

They are used only by `tests/test_oscal.py` to structurally validate the JSON
that `security_lakehouse.oscal` generates — never fetched at runtime. OSCAL is
published by NIST, a U.S. government agency; the schema documents are public
domain U.S. government work, same policy as the NIST catalogs referenced in
`src/security_lakehouse/framework_enrich.py`.

Re-fetch and replace both files, bump `OSCAL_VERSION` in
`src/security_lakehouse/oscal.py`, and re-run `tests/test_oscal.py` to pick up
a newer OSCAL release.
